checkout to specific tag and then checkout to one branch from that tag and then making commit to that branch.
A tag is a static label that marks a specific commit. It doesnt move like branch, even if you have made changes on any commit that is tagged, tag is gonna points to that older commit only 
not newly commit which you have done on top of older commit.
